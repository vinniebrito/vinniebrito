### Hey, Iâ€™m a Front-End Developer based in Brazil.

I have experience building responsive interfaces using Vue, TailwindCSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript, as well as integrating APIs to create dynamic and engaging user experiences.

Before transitioning to tech, I spent over 10 years working as an Architect and Urban Planner. This background provided me with a strong foundation in design, structure, and user experience, skills I now apply to developing better applications.

Iâ€™m passionate about solving real-world problems through code and always looking for opportunities to grow and collaborate.
